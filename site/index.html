                    <div>
                            <p>The car, after hesitating several times as though
                                    undecided what to do next, finally came to an
                                    unmistakable stop. The rear wheels, although
                                    equipped with heavy chains, spun around for a
                                    moment and then they also stopped.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                            <p>&ldquo;Looks as though we&rsquo;re stuck, Mike.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>The words came from a boy in the front seat,
                            but they were lost to the driver in the roar of the
                            wind as it drove the blinding snow against the windows
                            of the sedan.</p>
                            <p>The speaker tried again.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Looks as though we&rsquo;re stuck, Mike.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>This time he shouted at the top of his voice and
                            the driver turned his head.</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
                            <p>&ldquo;Stuck is right, begorra,&rdquo; he shouted back.
                            &ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s meself that&rsquo;s been expecting it fer
                            the last half hour, an&rsquo; how could ye expect inything
                            on wheels to git through sich drifts, I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;How about a shovel, Mike?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p class="highlight">The question came from a second boy in the back
                            seat and it also was shouted with all the strength of
                            a sound pair of lungs.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure and I&rsquo;ve got a shovel, do yez expect to dig
                            all the way to Skowhegan?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>The two boys, Bob and Jack Golden, were on
                            their way home from college for the Christmas holidays.
                            Unfortunately they had missed the train
                            which they should have taken at Boston, and the
                            only other one for the day would take them as far
                            as Waterville, nineteen miles from their home in
                            Skowhegan. Rather than wait over a day, they had
                            telegraphed to their father and he had sent his man,
                            Mike, to meet them.</p>
                            <p>The snow had begun to fall soon after they left
                            Portland and the storm had increased rapidly in violence
                            until, when they reached Waterville, at ten
                            o&rsquo;clock, two hours late, it had reached the proportions
                            of a blizzard. Mike had been dubious about
                            starting, declaring that they would never make it,
                            but the boys had laughed at his fears and, against
                            his better judgment, he had yielded to them.</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
                            <p>During the first hour they made seven miles,
                            plowing through snow up to wheel hubs. And this
                            brings us to the point where our story opens.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t be so bad as that,&rdquo; Bob said with
                            a laugh, as he opened the door and stepped out into
                            the storm. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the shovel, Mike?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s under the back sate,&rdquo; Mike shouted,
                            as he too got out of the car.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it quick, Jack,&rdquo; Bob called, as he
                            stuck his head in at the rear door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s colder than
                            Greenland out here.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Jack quickly pulled the shovel from beneath the
                            seat and handed it to his brother, who at once
                            started making the snow fly.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he shouted to Mike, who had gotten
                            back in the car, &ldquo;Back up and hit her hard and I
                            guess she&rsquo;ll go through. Don&rsquo;t think I ever saw
                            the snow come down so fast,&rdquo; he added, as he threw
                            the shovel back in and climbed in beside Mike.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; he shouted joyfully, a moment
                            later, as the big car plowed its way through the
                            drift. &ldquo;All it needs is a little elbow grease.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p class="highlight">But his joy was short lived for in less than a
                            hundred rods they struck another drift and again
                            the car came to a standstill.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;My turn this time,&rdquo; Jack shouted, and was out
                            almost as soon as the car stopped.</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
                            <p>This drift was deeper than the first one and it
                            took the boy all of fifteen minutes before he felt
                            that there was a chance for the car to win through.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll strike Skowhegan some time next summer
                            at this rate,&rdquo; he laughed, as he stamped his feet on
                            the running board.</p>
                            <p>As before, the car went through, but in less than
                            a hundred feet they came to a halt for a third time.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Bob shouted, as the car came to a
                            stop. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get through to-night, that&rsquo;s sure.
                            Suppose you turn around, Mike?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of trying?&rdquo; Jack asked, before
                            Mike had time to reply.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d probably get stuck just as quick if we
                            tried to go back. I move we stay here.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;How about it, Mike? Got plenty of gas?&rdquo;
                            Bob asked.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Filled her up in Waterville.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Then I think Jack&rsquo;s suggestion is a good one.
                            By running the engine once in a while we can keep
                            plenty warm and they&rsquo;ll probably break out the road
                            early in the morning. What do you say Mike?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure an I gess yer right. If we can&rsquo;t go ayther
                            forninst nor behind I guess we&rsquo;d better stand still.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good logic anyhow,&rdquo; Bob laughed, as he
                            climbed over the back of the seat and joined his
                            brother. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be as snug as a bug in a rug and
                            there&rsquo;s no danger of getting run into,&rdquo; he added, as
                            he curled up on the roomy seat and pulled a heavy
                            robe over himself.</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
                            <p>&ldquo;Not much need of traffic cops on this road tonight,&rdquo;
                            Jack shouted from the other corner of the
                            car.</p>
                            <p>Bob was just drifting off to sleep when, above
                            the shriek of the wind he heard a cry which brought
                            him sitting upright in an instant.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Did you hear that, Jack?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Listen:
                            there it is again.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Again came the cry in piercing tones now plainly
                            audible.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sounds like a girl,&rdquo; Bob cried, as he pushed open
                            the door and leaped out, closely followed by his
                            brother.</p>
                            <p>Breathlessly they listened for the call to be repeated,
                            but no sound save the howling of the wind
                            came to them.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Which way was it?&rdquo; Jack asked, straining his
                            ears.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; Bob replied, as he waded
                            around to the front of the car.</p>
                            <p>By this time Mike had joined them and, after listening
                            a moment longer, Bob said:</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;She must have given out. Mike, you hunt
                            around to the right, and Jack you go back a bit and
                            I&rsquo;ll see what I can find up ahead here. It isn&rsquo;t likely
                            that she&rsquo;s down by the river. If you find her yell,&rdquo;
                            he shouted as they started off.</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
                            <p class="highlight">The wind was still blowing a gale and the sharp
                            particles of snow stung like so many needles as Bob
                            faced into the storm. It was so dark that he could
                            hardly see his hand before his face and the headlights
                            were of little use as the car had stopped at
                            an angle to the road. The snow came nearly to his
                            waist as he plowed his way through.</p>
                            <p id="main">&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be very far off,&rdquo; he thought, as he
                            bent his head to the force of the wind. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
                            believe you could hear a steam whistle a hundred
                            feet away in this gale.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>He had not gone more than thirty feet from the
                            car when his knee struck something and the next
                            second he was bending over a form, which was
                            nearly buried in the snow. Quickly he straightened
                            up and, putting his hands to his mouth trumpet
                            fashion, he gave a yell that would have done credit
                            to a Comanche Indian.</p>
                            <p>As he again stooped and lifted the girl in his arms
                            she gave a low moan which he barely caught.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not dead at any rate,&rdquo; he muttered, as he
                            endeavored to start toward the car. But, although
                            the wind was now at his back, the snow was too
                            deep and he was unable to take a step. But help
                            was close at hand, as both Jack and Mike had heard
                            his cry.</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
                            <p>&ldquo;Give her to me,&rdquo; ordered the big Irishman, as
                            he reached Bob&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Now break trail an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
                            meself that&rsquo;ll take her back,&rdquo; and he took the girl
                            in his strong arms as though she were but a feather.</p>
                            <p>The boys kicked their way back, making a fairly
                            decent path through the snow, and in a few minutes
                            they had her in the car. Mike at once started the
                            engine, as it was far from warm, while Bob wrapped
                            her in a heavy robe and began to chafe her hands.
                            The girl was not unconscious, as he could tell by the
                            appearance of her eyes, but she seemed numbed
                            with the cold.</p>
                            <p>Quickly the heat from the exhaust made itself
                            felt and soon the rich color of health began to steal
                            back into the pale cheeks. The chattering of her
                            teeth gradually grew less and finally a faint smile
                            lighted up her face.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I hope&mdash;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;shake&mdash;the car&mdash;to
                            pieces,&rdquo; she said, evidently trying hard to make her
                            voice heard above the howling of the wind.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;ll hold together: she&rsquo;s had a lots
                            bigger shaking up than this and came through all
                            right,&rdquo; Bob assured her with a laugh.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;My, but this&mdash;robe&mdash;feels good,&rdquo; she declared.
                            &ldquo;It was so&mdash;cold out there&mdash;in the&mdash;snow, and&mdash;and
                            I thought I was&mdash;a goner.&rdquo;</p>
                            <div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
                            <p>In a short time she was recovered sufficiently to
                            tell them her story. It seemed that she had spent
                            the evening at a neighbor&rsquo;s only a few rods from
                            her home. She had started for home soon after
                            eleven o&rsquo;clock, never for a moment doubting her
                            ability to find her way. But she had entirely underestimated
                            the fury of the storm and bewildered by
                            the blinding snow had lost the path. For nearly
                            two hours she had stumbled about in the deep snow
                            before Bob had found her.</p>
                            <p>She told them that her name was Mary Scott and
                            that she was sure that she had not gone far from
                            her home. She also informed them that she was
                            twenty years old and was a school teacher. The
                            boys in turn introduced themselves and Bob asked:</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your folks be out looking for you?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Not likely. You see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;my
                            father is a farmer and he goes to bed early and no
                            doubt they were all fast asleep before ten o&rsquo;clock,
                            so you see they won&rsquo;t miss me till morning.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>It was now nearly two o&rsquo;clock and after some further
                            talk they, one by one, capitulated to the sand
                            man, all except Mike, who forced himself to keep
                            awake in order to &ldquo;kape up steam,&rdquo; as he afterward
                            told them.</p>
